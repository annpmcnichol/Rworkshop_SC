## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")
```
```{r}
## read gapminder csv. Note the readr:: prefix identifies which package it's in
gapminder <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv')

# inspect the dataset
gapminder #looks at all the data
head(gapminder) # gives the first 6 lines by default
tail(gapminder) # gives the last 6 lines by default

#summary statistics
str(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

install.packages("skimr")
skimr::skim(gapminder)

names(gapminder) # column names
dim(gapminder)   # dimensions
ncol(gapminder)  # number of columns
nrow(gapminder)  # number of rowa

# reverse-engineer dim
c(nrow(gapminder), ncol(gapminder))
```
